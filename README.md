# 3-Factor-ANOVA-on-Hardwood-Pressure-and-Cooking-Duration-for-Paper-Strength 

we are looking at effects of hardwood concentration in raw pulp, vat pressure, and pulp cooking duration on paper strength. There are three levels of hardwood concentration (2,4,8), three pressure levels (400,500,650), and two cooking times (3 hours, 4 hours) to choose from.
